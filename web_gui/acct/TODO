- factorize pie chart generation (in 'define' module)
- manage png generation concurrency (per session?)
- backport changes in user section (space used, pie chart in popup) to other sections
- manage list of entries within 2 tables (ENTRIES and ANNEX_INFO)
- clean "error 404" page
- security: add .htaccess in app/config driectory
- in pie charts: calibrate size units
- search section:	
	- extra filters in search section (type, status, size, last_access, last_mod, archive/release_class)
	- interpret path regexp like in rbh-report
	- better management of search limit (>500 causes error)
