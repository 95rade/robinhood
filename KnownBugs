Description:
	Process terminates with SEGFAULT when MySQL server restarts.
Cause:
	This is due to a bad resilience of MySQL client API to server crash when prepared statements are used.
	This is known as bug #33384 in MySQL tracker (see http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=33384 for current bug status).
Workaround:
	Disable prepared statements in Robinhood: to do so, use '--disable-prep-stmts' argument to ./configure
	before compiling the program or building the RPM.


Description:
	There are a lot of <defunc> process when reading Lustre's Changelogs.
Cause:
	In first Lustre 2.0 releases < 2.1, liblustreapi forks a process each time the changelog is reopened.
Workaround:
	Apply the patch from Lustre bugzilla ticket #23120, at least on the Lustre client where Robinhood runs.
