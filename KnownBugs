Description:
	There are a lot of <defunc> process when reading Lustre's Changelogs.
Cause:
	In first Lustre 2.0 releases < 2.1, liblustreapi forks a process each time the changelog is reopened.
Workaround:
	Apply the patch from Lustre bugzilla ticket #23120, at least on the Lustre client where Robinhood runs.

Description:
       rpmbuild complains about empty macro 'pkg_dependencies'
Cause:
       rpm or rpmbuild are too old (el4 distrib or earlier).
Workaround:
       Replace robinhood.spec.in with robinhood.old_spec.in.
       Then re-run "configure" and "make rpm".
