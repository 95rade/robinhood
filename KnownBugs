Description:
	Process terminates with SEGFAULT when MySQL server restarts.
Cause:
	This is due to a bad resilience of MySQL client API to server crash when prepared statements are used.
	This is known as bug #33384 in MySQL tracker (see http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=33384 for current bug status).
Workaround:
	Disable prepared statements in Robinhood: to do so, use '--disable-prep-stmts' argument to ./configure
	before compiling the program or building the RPM.


Description:
	There are a lot of <defunc> process when reading Lustre's Changelogs.
Cause:
	In early Lustre 2.0 releases (before alpha8) , liblustreapi forks a process each time the changelog is reopened.
Workaround:
	Make Robihood trap SIGCHLD, by specifiying specifying the following option to configure: "--enable-llapi-fork-support".
Side effect:
	Trapping events causes some internal calls to be interrupted by signals.

Description:
	"with" or "bcond_with" macros are unknown when building the RPM.
Cause:
	rpm or rpmbuild are too old.
Workaround:
	Replace robinhood.spec.in with robinhood.old_spec.in.
	Then re-run "configure" and "make rpm".
