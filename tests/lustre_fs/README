How to run the tests for Lustre

1) Have a Lustre filesystem

Lustre must be mounted as /mnt/lustre before running setup step and
tests. You can use llmount.sh to create the filesystem.

For instance, as root, run:
  OSTSIZE=400000 OSTCOUNT=4 /usr/lib64/lustre/tests/llmount.sh

2) Set the purpose environment variable

export PURPOSE=LUSTRE_HSM

Available values for PURPOSE are:
  TMP_FS_MGR
  LUSTRE_HSM
  BACKUP
  SHOOK

If unset, the default for PURPOSE is TMP_FS_MGR

3) Setup the test environment

As root, run:
  ./1-test_setup.sh

This will initialize the sql database, create the changelog client,
start the Lustre posix copytool, and enable the HSM coordinator.

4) Run the tests

For brief output:
	./2-run-tests.sh -q

For full output:
	./2-run-tests.sh

To run only some tests (here, test 3 and 4):
    ./2-run-tests.sh 3,4

To get a debug output, set DEBUG to 1:
   DEBUG=1 ./2-run-tests.sh
